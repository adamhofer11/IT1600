### Advanced Git Commands
1. **git rebase**: Reapply commits on top of another base.
   ```bash
   git rebase main
   ```
2. **git stash**: Temporarily save your work without committing it.
   ```bash
   git stash
   ```

   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
   ```

### GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions allows you to automate workflows like testing, building, or deploying your code. You define these workflows using YAML files in the `.github/workflows` directory.
